            <p>A dough's first rising can be done in the fridge overnight. This slows down the time it takes to rise to double its size, giving it a deeper flavour. It's also a great timesaver, as you can start it the night before, then finish it off the next day.

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                    <ul>

                        <li>500g strong white bread flour</li>
                        <li>2 tsp of salt</li>
                        <li>7g of fast-action dried yeast</li>
                        <li>3 table spoon of oil</li>
                        <li>300ml of water</li>
                   
                    </ul>
                <h2>Method</h2>

                    <ol>

                        <li>    Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
                            
                            
                        <li>    Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
                            
                            
                        <li>    Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
                            
                            
                        <li>    Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.
                            
                            
                        <li>    Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.
                            
                            
                        <li>    Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.
                            
                            
                        <li>    Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.
                            
                            
                        <li>    Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.
                            
                            
                        <li>    Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
